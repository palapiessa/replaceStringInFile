# replaceStringInFile

This application is written in C#.
String to be changed and string to replace with are collected from commandline after running replaceStringInFile.exe
Then you must give also root folder for file searches. All folders under root are processed recursively.
Filenames to be updated must be defined in project settings.
I tried to implement string replace script in poweshell but found it difficult due escaping characters.
